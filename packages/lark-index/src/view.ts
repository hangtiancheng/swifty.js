/**
 * Project-wide base View.
 *
 * All page-level and column-level views extend this class to inherit:
 *   - a consistent destroy log gated by the Lark debug flag
 *   - a `guard()` helper that swallows handler exceptions so a single
 *     misbehaving handler cannot tear down the whole frame digest
 *
 * Runtime semantics are identical to View.extend({...}); this file simply
 * gives every concrete view a single inheritance point for future cross-
 * cutting concerns (analytics, error reporting, feature flags, etc.).
